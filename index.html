		<h1>Title of Phone Version</h1>
		<h6>Brief description of of the phone.  Almost like a tag line for it.</h6>

		<p>A detailed description of the phone in a summary format.  Giving off the key features of the phone itself.  Just some more fluff put in verses lorum ipsem text that I do not understand.  I feel that ones content should be put in, and if there is no content as the example to simply use... once thoughts.</p>

		<a href="#">A link showing a video version of the phone.</a>  <!-- With an attached image showing an arrow like play feature (like how it is with YouTube).  So both the words and image form together for when it is time to click the link, when scrolling over, there is no overlap. -->

		<!-- The top is top left side of this section.  The top right has an image with a scroll feature to move the image of the phone in 360 degrees.  So I'm guessing that is a JavaScript or some other type of script to creat that kind of format. -->

		<!-- The next section seems to show a form of illustrtated exclusive type of font for this type of phone.  It is in 3 columns.  
		Screen / Camera / Support
		4.5inches / 12MP / 2TB
		Touchscreen / Auto-focus, Large Pixel / MicroSD card

	</section>
		<!-- Image expanded from left to right sides for that full width.  In addition there is text (title / subtitle / bulleted strengths) -->

	<section>
		<!-- This section has 3 sections of images (different angles of the cell phone) -->
	</section>

	<section>
		<!-- This section has centered title and brief paragraph (1 liner).  It is in discussion of feature (content with heading (being that it is in bold and bigger than paragraph, not doubled in size) and paragraph description) on the left and image of the feature on the right.  It is in 3 rows (one form of feature with image on top of each other, giving 3 descriptions) Center verions is opposite direction of image and content, but the same rules apply.  So 1 and 3 are in the same content on the left and image on the right.  

		In addition, this section has a background image layed out towards the bottom as it is blended in from dark color to lighter color where the lighter color is the shaded version of the image to have the blend together.  Great for separating this section from sections above and below.  

		Also note that the images are animated (dynamic), in some way, for desktop and tablet, but is static on handheld device. -->


		<article>
			<h5>Feature of Phone</h5>
			<p>Feature being described in a paragraph, enough for a 4 liner.  Mind you, the padding on left and right, combined, are the same width as the paragraph centered.  About this much words, or less.</p>

	<section>
		<!-- This section is based on 2 rows. (actually now that I see it after looking over this section again visually, I see that the image takes up the space on the left and right side.  Only difference is the image is either towards the left or right sides.  Looking further in the responsiveness of it, it would seem like the wording and image is side by side, until it shows up on handheld device, where the wording is above the image.) 

		On the left side is an image on top of main title, on top of sub title description, on top of 3 bulleted descriptions, on top of sentanced description with arrow combined as a link to go elsewhere.  They are all in alignment to the left side, give or take any margins on its left.   

		On the right side is the imaged version of the description on the left. 

		Fair distance apart from each other.  -->

		<!-- The next section shows the image on the left hand side and the wording on the right.  This would seem to be a pattern for them in that sense of images and words on the left and right hand sides.  But in a form of difference in the eyes of the viewer.  So the remainder of images / text would be in this same section, but different article for "content sectioning".  As shown below. -->

		<!-- This section discusses the photo quality of the cell phone.  Full width of the image of a town in the background with cell phone centered as it took the picture of the background town or city.  Text is centered at the very top (about 1/4 of the full image) with heading / subheading / and 3 bulleted details of the camera feature horizontally from left to right (yet still centered).

		In responsive setting for the handheld device, the bulleted list becomes horizonal (one on top of other)
